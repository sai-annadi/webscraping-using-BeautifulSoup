# webscraping-using-BeautifulSoup

Web scraping can be accomplished using different libraries, and two popular combinations are Selenium with ChromeDriver and BeautifulSoup with Requests. Selenium with ChromeDriver enables browser automation, making it suitable for websites with JavaScript-rendered content. Developers can simulate user interactions with the website, extract data, and perform complex tasks like form filling and button clicks. Once the data is collected, it can be organized into a structured format using Pandas and saved as a CSV file for further analysis and processing. This approach is powerful for scraping dynamic websites and handling JavaScript-heavy content.

On the other hand, BeautifulSoup with Requests is a lightweight solution for scraping static websites that do not require JavaScript rendering. It allows developers to fetch web page content efficiently using HTTP requests and parse the HTML structure to extract desired data elements using CSS selectors or XPath. The extracted data can then be easily organized into a DataFrame using Pandas and exported to a CSV file for data analysis and manipulation. This combination is well-suited for websites with minimal dynamic content and provides a straightforward approach to web scraping and data collection. Both methods, depending on the requirements, offer effective ways to gather data from websites and prepare it for further exploration and utilization.
